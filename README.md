## Case 1: ChatGPT

### Overview
ChatGPT is an AI model developed by OpenAI, based on the **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** architecture. It is designed to understand and generate human-like text based on a given prompt.

### Key Features
- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Uses the self-attention mechanism to process sequences of data in parallel.
- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: Pre-trained on massive datasets and fine-tuned with supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RLHF).
- **API Integration**: Allows seamless integration into various applications, enabling conversational AI features in custom systems.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Continuously improving by capturing user feedback.
